# Model-based Analysis of Protein Degradability

Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has rapidly emerged as a therapeutic modality to eliminate previously undruggable proteins through hijacking the cellâ€™s endogenous protein degradation machinery. However, development of TPD compounds is largely driven by trial-and-error. Recent systematic TPD studies of the kinome have shown dramatic differences in degradation between kinases with otherwise similar drug-target engagement, suggesting unexplained factors influencing degradability. We therefore developed a machine learning model, MAPD (Model-based Analysis of Protein Degradability), to predict degradability from protein features that encompass post-translational modifications, protein stability, protein expression and protein-protein interactions. We found 5 features to achieve optimal performance of MAPD, with ubiquitination rate being the most highly predictive. 

To enable prioritization of degradable proteins by scientists and the public, we created an interactive web platform at http://mapd.cistrome.org. This platform incorporates protein-intrinsic features, MAPD predictions, E2 accessibility of ubiquitination sites, ligandability, and disease associations, which could help researchers select rational targets for developing degraders.
