Column	Description
Gene	Gene name
Entry	Uniprot ID
PDB	PDB structure used for modeling
Residue	Lysine or UB Site
Position	Position of the lysine residue
E2_Acc	The fraction of models in which the Ub site was in the quadrant facing the E2 and within a reasonable distance
E2_Acc_Adj	The fraction of models in which the Ub site was in the quadrant facing the E2 and within a reasonable distance and the C-alpha->C-beta vector is not facing in completely the opposite direction.
Dist3D	The distance between the lysine residue and likely PROTAC binding sites (e.g. ATP binding sites)
RSA	Relative Solvent Accessibility
b	b-factor indicating the flexibility of the lysine residue
sse	The secondary structure of the lysine residue
sse3	The secondary structure of the lysine residue
